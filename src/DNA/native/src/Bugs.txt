Known Bugs that haven't yet been fixed
--------------------------------------

There is a memory leak somewhere. Haven't looked into it much yet.

There is a problem with calling a generic method within a generic interface, when the
call-point is within a generic method itself.
This bug may have large implications for how the generic system works, so may be quite
a lot of work to fix.
This bug means that the LINQ .ThenBy() operator cannot work.

If a field in a nested class references the containing class then the memory/stack size of the type
is not yet known, so function calls on the type fail, because the parameters size has been
calculated incorrectly.

Finalization currently happens in any thread, when objects are allocated.
Should probably change this to have a proper finalizer thread, like in the real .NET
